# Spotify Home-Page's Clone


I am just overwhelmed with happiness and feeling so much proud of myself that on Engineer's Day, 2023, I had finally achieved another milestone by engineering my 1st clone of a website, which is being used by millions, if not billions.


I developed a clone of Spotify's home page (just the frontend part without JavaScript), by using technologies: HTML & CSS.


In this clone of Spotify's home page, I tried my best to make it look almost like a Spotify's original webpage, in the first impression. This clone webpage has almost each and everything structured & displayed exactly like Spotify's home webpage. It is divided into three sections or parts, among which:

    1. Sidebar on the left of the document: It displays navigation section on the top, to navigate to other pages of the website, then below the navigation section, it has library section which displays audio libraries, and options to add/create new library, show more libraries & browse podcasts;

    2. Main content: It displays on the top, a sticky-navigation bar with options like, navigate to next page, navigate to previous page, explore premium, install Spotify app and user profile, and below the navigation bar, it displays all audios/musics/podcasts in the form of cards, using flex-box layout; and

    3. Music player: It displays first, the information of current audio playing, like, its poster or thumbnail, title or name, singer or creator and a like button to save to liked songs library, then it has playback controls with options like play/pause, forward, backward, shuffle & loop, and playback bar with song timing (current & total time), then at last it has some other options like, more about current playing audio, lyrics, queue, volume control and picture-in-picture mode.


I really enjoyed developing/engineering this project as it is my 1st time cloning a website (Spotify) which is used by millions of people. I once just dreamed that when I will clone a website on my own, and I finally achieve this. Furthermore, I completed this project in around 4 hours, including understanding the project, finding the approach, building logic and coding/development.
